Just a guy, on his computer at 2:00 am, trying to make cool stuff. I grew up
with a desire to design and build things, and access to graph paper from my
dad, which I used all the time.

I wanted to capture that ease of quickly sketching an idea on a sheet of
graph paper, in a digital way, without having to learn a complicated piece of
software. Disappointed with the options available online, and insired by some
people who had built their own, I decided to build what I wanted.
