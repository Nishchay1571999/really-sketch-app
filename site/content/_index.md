  <h2>What is this?</h2>
  <p>Online graph paper, the kind that you can interact with the way you would with a real sheet of graph paper. A digital translation, if you will, of a kid with a piece of graph paper, a pencil, a straight edge, and a compass.</p>
  <p>It is by no means a fully fledged drafting program, or a CAD replacement, or vector art software, or anything like that. It wants to be more like the Microsoft Paint of 2D drafting.</p>
  <p>Hopefully much easier to pick up than more serious software, but still giving you the ability to sketch cool stuff with enough patience.</p>
